## This is a program to troll your friends (or enemies) and fill their Twitter feed with song lyrics or any other text file, one mention per line.
## Please don't over-spam. Limit calls to once every 3 seconds (hence the sleep function). 
## I am in no way associated with Twitter.


## Need to have tweepy and time installed.
import tweepy
import time

## Acquire keys and tokens from dev twitter account. Can apply through https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access
key = ""
private_key = ""
token = ""
private_token = ""
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(key, private_key)
auth.set_access_token(token, private_token)
api = tweepy.API(auth)

## Used to eliminate duplicate lines as Twitter does not like that.
i = 0

## Be sure to include the @ symbol of your target.
twitter_handle = "@examplehandle"

## Filename of text file. Be sure to run the program in the same directory as the text file. If not, specify path.
filename = ""

## Where the magic happens.
with open(filename,"r") as f:
    for line in f:
        post = twitter_handle + " " + line + " " + str(i)
        api.update_status(post)
        i += 1
        time.sleep(3) ## Try not to lower below 1 call/second, lines can get mismatched if they are sent out too quick.
